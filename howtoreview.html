		<h2>How to review</h2>

		<p>We want our teaching materials to be educational, engaging, respectful, and accurate.
		Thus, we want each of them to be reviewed by one content expert (and ideally one who has
		taught the topic themselves), according to our rubric.
		That way, we can help the content creator to improve their materials,
		and we can help other teachers decide which materials to use in their classes.
		</p>

		<p>Here are the steps for reviewing:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Open our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zw7qX2EAO08rGAjl9683aVxtsAoZQLxmy7evu2my4OY/edit">Curriculum Review Template</a>.
			<li>Click "Make a copy".</li>
			<li>Set permission to “Anyone with link can view”.</li>
			<li>Read through the rubric.</li>
			<li>Start going through the materials with the criteria in mind, making notes as you go along.</li>
			<li>Once you're done, make a pull request on <a href="https://github.com/girldevelopit/gdi-curriculum-site">our repo</a> that adds the review link to <a href="https://github.com/girldevelopit/gdi-curriculum-site/blob/master/materials.js">materials.js</a>.
			</li>
